Eschewing traditional leather or nubuck seen on most AJ4s, the upper utilizes a shaggy suede in a vibrant purple hue. Lime green accents the eyelets and midsole, while the Jumpman logo on the tongue appears in Safety Orange. Black molded wings and back heel tab are contrasted in black, while the midsole appears in the classic white/black combination with an exposed Nike Air unit in the heel."}
