The shoe's nubuck upper construction appears in black and Dark Mocha, accented by hits of University Red. The standout feature is the lateral-side Swoosh, which sports a backward application. A standard Swoosh appears on the medial side, while the tongue, medial quarter panel and sockliner include Cactus Jack branding. The heels sport a 'Wings' logo on the right shoe and Scott's crudely drawn face on the left to complete the collaborative look."}
